Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she
was alone, Mrs. Freeman
had two others, forward and
reverse, that she used for all her human
dealings. Her
forward expression was steady and driving like the
advance
of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to left
or right but turned as
the story turned as if they
followed a yellow line down the center of it.
She
seldom used the other expression because it was not
often necessary for her
to retract a statement, but when she did, her face
came to a complete stop,
there was an almost imperceptible movement of
her black eyes, during which they
seemed to be receding, and then the
observer would see that Mrs. Freeman, though
she might stand there as
real as several grain sacks thrown on top of each
other, was no longer
there in spirit. As for getting anything across to
her when this was the
case, Mrs. Hopewell had given it up. She might talk
her head off. Mrs.
Freeman could never be brought to admit herself wrong
to any point. She
would stand there and if she could be brought to say
anything, it was
something like,
“
Well, I wouldn
’
t of said it was and I wouldn
’
t
of said it
wasn
’
t
”
or letting her gaze range over the top kitchen shelf where
there
was an assortment of dusty bottles, she might remark,
“
I see you ain
’
t ate
many of them figs you put up last summer.
”
They carried on their most
important business in the kitchen at breakfast.
Every morning Mrs.
Hopewell got up at seven
o
’
clock and lit her gas
heater and Joy
’
s. Joy was
her daughter, a large blonds girl who had an
artificial leg. Mrs. Hopewell
thought of her as a child though she was
thirty
-
two years old and highly
educated. Joy would get up while her
mother was eating and lumber into the
bathroom and slam the door, and
before long, Mrs. Freeman would arrive at the
back door. Joy would hear
her mother call,
“
Come on in,
”
and then they
would talk for a while in
low voices that were indistinguishable in the
bathroom. By the time Joy
came in, they had usually finished the weather
report and were on one or
the other of Mrs. Freeman
’
s daughters, Glynese or
Carramae. Joy called

them Glycerin and Caramel. Glynese, a redhead,
was eighteen and had
many admirers; Carramae, a blonde, was only fifteen but
already married
and pregnant. She could not keep anything on her
stomach. Every
morning Mrs. Freeman told Mrs. Hopewell how many times she
had
vomited since the last report.
Mrs. Hopewell liked to tell people
that Glynese and Carramae were two
of the finest girls she knew and that Mrs.
Freeman was a
lady
and that she
was never ashamed to take her anywhere or
introduce her to anybody they
might meet. Then she would tell how she had
happened to hire the
Freemans in the first place and how they were a godsend to
her and how
she had had them four years. The reason for her keeping them
so long
was that they were not trash. They were good country people.
She had
telephoned the man whose name they had given as reference and he had
told her that Mr. Freeman was a good farmer but that his wife was the
nosiest
woman ever to walk the earth.
“
She
’
s got to be into everything,
”
the man
said.
“
If she don
’
t get there before the dust settles, you can bet
she
’
s
dead, that
’
s all. She
’
ll want to know all your business. I can stand
him real good,
”
he had said,
“
but me nor my wife neither could have
stood that
woman one more minute on this place.
”
That had put Mrs.
Hopewell off for a
few days.
She had hired them in the end because there were no other
applicants but
she had made up her mind beforehand exactly how she would handle
the
woman. Since she was the type who had to be into everything, then,
Mrs.
Hopewell had decided, she would not only let her be into everything, she
would
see to it
that she was into everything
–
she would give her the
responsibility of everything, she would put her in charge. Mrs. Hopewell
had no bad qualities of her own but she was able to use other people
’
s in
such a
constructive way that she had kept them four years.
Nothing is
perfect. This was one of Mrs. Hopewell
’
s favorite sayings.
Another
was: that is life! And still another, the most important, was:
well, other people have their opinions too. She would make these
statements, usually at the table, in a tone of gentle insistence as if no one
held them but her, and the large hulking Joy, whose constant outrage had
obliterated every expression from her face, would stare just a little to the
side of her, her eyes icy blue, with the look of someone who had achieved
blindness by an act of will and means to keep it.
When Mrs. Hopewell said
to Mrs. Freeman that life was like that, Mrs.
Freeman would say,
“
I always said
so myself.
”
Nothing had been arrived
at by anyone that had not first been
arrived at by her. She was quicker
than Mr. Freeman. When Mrs.
Hopewell said to her after they had been
on the place for a while,
“
You know,
you
’
re the wheel behind the wheel,
”
and winked, Mrs. Freeman had said,
“
I know
it. I
’
ve always been quick.
It
’
s some that are quicker than
others.
”

“
Everybody is different,
”
Mrs. Hopewell said.
“
Yes, most
people is,
”
Mrs. Freeman said.
“
It takes all kinds to make the
world.
”
“
I always said it did myself.
”
The girl was used to this
kind of dialogue for breakfast and more of it for
dinner; sometimes they had it
for supper too. When they had no guest
they ate in the kitchen because
that was easier. Mrs. Freeman always
managed to arrive at some point
during the meal and to watch them finish
it. She would stand in the
doorway if it were summer but in the winter
she would stand with one elbow on
top of the refrigerator and look down
at them, or she would stand by the gas
heater, lifting the back of her skirt
slightly. Occasionally she would
stand against the wall and roll her head
from side to side. At no time was
she in any hurry to leave. All this was
very trying on Mrs. Hopewell but
she was a woman of great patience. She
realized that nothing is perfect
and that in the Freemans she had good
country people and that if, in this day
and age, you get good country
people, you had better hang onto them.
She
had had plenty of experience with trash. Before the Freemans she had
averaged one tenant family a year. The wives of these farmers were not
the
kind you would want to be around you for very long. Mrs. Hopewell,
who had
divorced her husband long ago, needed someone to walk over
the fields with her;
and when Joy had to be impressed for these services,
her remarks were usually so
ugly and her face so glum that Mrs. Hopewell
would say,
“
If you can
’
t come
pleasantly, I don
’
t want you at all,
”
to which
the girl, standing square and
rigid
-
shouldered with her neck thrust
slightly forward, would reply,
“
If you
want me, here I am
–
LIKE I AM.
”
Mrs. Hopewell excused this attitude
because of the leg (which had been
shot off in a hunting accident when Joy was
ten). It was hard for Mrs.
Hopewell to realize that her child was
thirty
-
two now and that for more
than twenty years she had had only one
leg. She thought of her still as a
child because it tore her heart to
think instead of the poor stout girl in her
thirties who had never danced a step
or had any
normal
good times. Her
name was really Joy but as soon
as she was twenty
-
one and away from
home, she had had it legally changed.
Mrs. Hopewell was certain that she
had thought and thought until she had hit
upon the ugliest name in any
language. Then she had gone and had the
beautiful name, Joy, changed
without telling her mother until after she had done
it. Her legal name was
Hulga.
When Mrs. Hopewell thought the name,
Hulga, she thought of the broad
Page

blank hull of a battleship. She would not
use it. She continued to call her
Joy to which the girl responded but in a
purely mechanical way.
Hulga had learned to tolerate Mrs. Freeman who
saved her from taking
walks with her mother. Even Glynese and Carramae
were useful when
they occupied attention that might otherwise have been directed
at her.
At first she had thought she could not stand Mrs. Freeman for she
had
found it was not possible to be rude to her. Mrs. Freeman would take
on
strange resentments and for days together she would be sullen but the
source
of her displeasure was always obscure; a direct attack, a positive
leer, blatant
ugliness to her face
–
these never touched her. And without
warning one
day, she began calling her Hulga.
She did not call her that in front of
Mrs. Hopewell who would have been
incensed but when she and the girl happened to
be out of the house
together, she would say something and add the name Hulga to
the end of
it, and the big spectacled Joy
-
Hulga would scowl and redden as if her
privacy had been intruded upon. She considered the name her personal
affair. She had arrived at it first purely on the basis of its ugly sound
and
then the full genius of its fitness had struck her. She had a vision
of the
name working like the ugly sweating Vulcan who stayed in the furnace
and
to whom, presumably, the goddess had to come when called. She saw
it as
the name of her highest creative act. One of her major triumphs was
that
her mother had not been able to turn her dust into Joy, but the greater
one was
that she had been able to turn it herself into Hulga. However,
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s relish for using the name only irritated her. It was as if
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s beady steel
-
pointed eyes had penetrated far enough
behind her face to
reach some secret fact. Something about her seemed to
fascinate Mrs.
Freeman and then one day Hulga realized that it was the
artificial leg.
Mrs. Freeman had a special fondness for the details of secret
infections, hidden
deformities, assaults upon children. Of diseases, she
preferred the
lingering or incurable. Hulga had heard Mrs. Hopewell give
her the details
of the hunting accident, how the leg had been literally
blasted off, how she had
never lost consciousness. Mrs. Freeman could
listen to it any time as if
it had happened an hour ago.
When Hulga stumped into the kitchen in the
morning (she could walk
without making the awful noise but she made it
–
Mrs.
Hopewell was
certain
–
because it was ugly
-
sounding), she glanced at them and
did not
speak. Mrs. Hopewell would be in her red kimono with her hair tied
around her head in rags. She would be sitting at the table, finishing her
breakfast and Mrs. Freeman would be hanging by her elbow outward
from the
refrigerator, looking down at the table. Hulga always put her
eggs on the
stove to boil and then stood over them with her arms folded,
and Mrs. Hopewell
would look at her
–
a kind of indirect gaze divided
between her and Mrs. Freeman
–
and would think that if she would only
keep herself up a little, she wouldn
’
t
be so bad looking. There was

she had made up her mind beforehand exactly how she would handle
the
woman. Since she was the type who had to be into everything, then,
Mrs.
Hopewell had decided, she would not only let her be into everything, she
would
see to it
that she was into everything
–
she would give her the
responsibility of everything, she would put her in charge. Mrs. Hopewell
had no bad qualities of her own but she was able to use other people
’
s in
such a
constructive way that she had kept them four years.
Nothing is
perfect. This was one of Mrs. Hopewell
’
s favorite sayings.
Another
was: that is life! And still another, the most important, was:
well, other people have their opinions too. She would make these
statements, usually at the table, in a tone of gentle insistence as if no one
held them but her, and the large hulking Joy, whose constant outrage had
obliterated every expression from her face, would stare just a little to the
side of her, her eyes icy blue, with the look of someone who had achieved
blindness by an act of will and means to keep it.
When Mrs. Hopewell said
to Mrs. Freeman that life was like that, Mrs.
Freeman would say,
“
I always said
so myself.
”
Nothing had been arrived
at by anyone that had not first been
arrived at by her. She was quicker
than Mr. Freeman. When Mrs.
Hopewell said to her after they had been
on the place for a while,
“
You know,
you
’
re the wheel behind the wheel,
”
and winked, Mrs. Freeman had said,
“
I know
it. I
’
ve always been quick.
It
’
s some that are quicker than
others.

“
Everybody is different,
”
Mrs. Hopewell said.
“
Yes, most
people is,
”
Mrs. Freeman said.
“
It takes all kinds to make the
world.
”
“
I always said it did myself.
”
The girl was used to this
kind of dialogue for breakfast and more of it for
dinner; sometimes they had it
for supper too. When they had no guest
they ate in the kitchen because
that was easier. Mrs. Freeman always
managed to arrive at some point
during the meal and to watch them finish
it. She would stand in the
doorway if it were summer but in the winter
she would stand with one elbow on
top of the refrigerator and look down
at them, or she would stand by the gas
heater, lifting the back of her skirt
slightly. Occasionally she would
stand against the wall and roll her head
from side to side. At no time was
she in any hurry to leave. All this was
very trying on Mrs. Hopewell but
she was a woman of great patience. She
realized that nothing is perfect
and that in the Freemans she had good
country people and that if, in this day
and age, you get good country
people, you had better hang onto them.
She
had had plenty of experience with trash. Before the Freemans she had
averaged one tenant family a year. The wives of these farmers were not
the
kind you would want to be around you for very long. Mrs. Hopewell,
who had
divorced her husband long ago, needed someone to walk over
the fields with her;
and when Joy had to be impressed for these services,
her remarks were usually so
ugly and her face so glum that Mrs. Hopewell
would say,
“
If you can
’
t come
pleasantly, I don
’
t want you at all,
”
to which
the girl, standing square and
rigid
-
shouldered with her neck thrust
slightly forward, would reply,
“
If you
want me, here I am
–
LIKE I AM.
”
Mrs. Hopewell excused this attitude
because of the leg (which had been
shot off in a hunting accident when Joy was
ten). It was hard for Mrs.
Hopewell to realize that her child was
thirty
-
two now and that for more
than twenty years she had had only one
leg. She thought of her still as a
child because it tore her heart to
think instead of the poor stout girl in her
thirties who had never danced a step
or had any
normal
good times. Her
name was really Joy but as soon
as she was twenty
-
one and away from
home, she had had it legally changed.
Mrs. Hopewell was certain that she
had thought and thought until she had hit
upon the ugliest name in any
language. Then she had gone and had the
beautiful name, Joy, changed
without telling her mother until after she had done
it. Her legal name was
Hulga.
When Mrs. Hopewell thought the name,
Hulga, she thought of the broad

blank hull of a battleship. She would not
use it. She continued to call her
Joy to which the girl responded but in a
purely mechanical way.
Hulga had learned to tolerate Mrs. Freeman who
saved her from taking
walks with her mother. Even Glynese and Carramae
were useful when
they occupied attention that might otherwise have been directed
at her.
At first she had thought she could not stand Mrs. Freeman for she
had
found it was not possible to be rude to her. Mrs. Freeman would take
on
strange resentments and for days together she would be sullen but the
source
of her displeasure was always obscure; a direct attack, a positive
leer, blatant
ugliness to her face
–
these never touched her. And without
warning one
day, she began calling her Hulga.
She did not call her that in front of
Mrs. Hopewell who would have been
incensed but when she and the girl happened to
be out of the house
together, she would say something and add the name Hulga to
the end of
it, and the big spectacled Joy
-
Hulga would scowl and redden as if her
privacy had been intruded upon. She considered the name her personal
affair. She had arrived at it first purely on the basis of its ugly sound
and
then the full genius of its fitness had struck her. She had a vision
of the
name working like the ugly sweating Vulcan who stayed in the furnace
and
to whom, presumably, the goddess had to come when called. She saw
it as
the name of her highest creative act. One of her major triumphs was
that
her mother had not been able to turn her dust into Joy, but the greater
one was
that she had been able to turn it herself into Hulga. However,
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s relish for using the name only irritated her. It was as if
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s beady steel
-
pointed eyes had penetrated far enough
behind her face to
reach some secret fact. Something about her seemed to
fascinate Mrs.
Freeman and then one day Hulga realized that it was the
artificial leg.
Mrs. Freeman had a special fondness for the details of secret
infections, hidden
deformities, assaults upon children. Of diseases, she
preferred the
lingering or incurable. Hulga had heard Mrs. Hopewell give
her the details
of the hunting accident, how the leg had been literally
blasted off, how she had
never lost consciousness. Mrs. Freeman could
listen to it any time as if
it had happened an hour ago.
When Hulga stumped into the kitchen in the
morning (she could walk
without making the awful noise but she made it
–
Mrs.
Hopewell was
certain
–
because it was ugly
-
sounding), she glanced at them and
did not
speak. Mrs. Hopewell would be in her red kimono with her hair tied
around her head in rags. She would be sitting at the table, finishing her
breakfast and Mrs. Freeman would be hanging by her elbow outward
from the
refrigerator, looking down at the table. Hulga always put her
eggs on the
stove to boil and then stood over them with her arms folded,
and Mrs. Hopewell
would look at her
–
a kind of indirect gaze divided
between her and Mrs. Freeman
–
and would think that if she would only
keep herself up a little, she wouldn
’
t
be so bad looking. There was

Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she
was alone, Mrs. Freeman
had two others, forward and
reverse, that she used for all her human
dealings. Her
forward expression was steady and driving like the
advance
of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to left
or right but turned as
the story turned as if they
followed a yellow line down the center of it.
She
seldom used the other expression because it was not
often necessary for her
to retract a statement, but when she did, her face
came to a complete stop,
there was an almost imperceptible movement of
her black eyes, during which they
seemed to be receding, and then the
observer would see that Mrs. Freeman, though
she might stand there as
real as several grain sacks thrown on top of each
other, was no longer
there in spirit. As for getting anything across to
her when this was the
case, Mrs. Hopewell had given it up. She might talk
her head off. Mrs.
Freeman could never be brought to admit herself wrong
to any point. She
would stand there and if she could be brought to say
anything, it was
something like,
“
Well, I wouldn
’
t of said it was and I wouldn
’
t
of said it
wasn
’
t
”
or letting her gaze range over the top kitchen shelf where
there
was an assortment of dusty bottles, she might remark,
“
I see you ain
’
t ate
many of them figs you put up last summer.
”
They carried on their most
important business in the kitchen at breakfast.
Every morning Mrs.
Hopewell got up at seven
o
’
clock and lit her gas
heater and Joy
’
s. Joy was
her daughter, a large blonds girl who had an
artificial leg. Mrs. Hopewell
thought of her as a child though she was
thirty
-
two years old and highly
educated. Joy would get up while her
mother was eating and lumber into the
bathroom and slam the door, and
before long, Mrs. Freeman would arrive at the
back door. Joy would hear
her mother call,
“
Come on in,
”
and then they
would talk for a while in
low voices that were indistinguishable in the
bathroom. By the time Joy
came in, they had usually finished the weather
report and were on one or
the other of Mrs. Freeman
’
s daughters, Glynese or
Carramae. Joy called

them Glycerin and Caramel. Glynese, a redhead,
was eighteen and had
many admirers; Carramae, a blonde, was only fifteen but
already married
and pregnant. She could not keep anything on her
stomach. Every
morning Mrs. Freeman told Mrs. Hopewell how many times she
had
vomited since the last report.
Mrs. Hopewell liked to tell people
that Glynese and Carramae were two
of the finest girls she knew and that Mrs.
Freeman was a
lady
and that she
was never ashamed to take her anywhere or
introduce her to anybody they
might meet. Then she would tell how she had
happened to hire the
Freemans in the first place and how they were a godsend to
her and how
she had had them four years. The reason for her keeping them
so long
was that they were not trash. They were good country people.
She had
telephoned the man whose name they had given as reference and he had
told her that Mr. Freeman was a good farmer but that his wife was the
nosiest
woman ever to walk the earth.
“
She
’
s got to be into everything,
”
the man
said.
“
If she don
’
t get there before the dust settles, you can bet
she
’
s
dead, that
’
s all. She
’
ll want to know all your business. I can stand
him real good,
”
he had said,
“
but me nor my wife neither could have
stood that
woman one more minute on this place.
”
That had put Mrs.
Hopewell off for a
few days.
She had hired them in the end because there were no other
applicants but
she had made up her mind beforehand exactly how she would handle
the
woman. Since she was the type who had to be into everything, then,
Mrs.
Hopewell had decided, she would not only let her be into everything, she

thirties who had never danced a step
or had any
normal
good times. Her
name was really Joy but as soon
as she was twenty
-
one and away from
home, she had had it legally changed.
Mrs. Hopewell was certain that she
had thought and thought until she had hit
upon the ugliest name in any
language. Then she had gone and had the
beautiful name, Joy, changed
without telling her mother until after she had done
it. Her legal name was
Hulga.
When Mrs. Hopewell thought the name,
Hulga, she thought of the broad

blank hull of a battleship. She would not
use it. She continued to call her
Joy to which the girl responded but in a
purely mechanical way.
Hulga had learned to tolerate Mrs. Freeman who
saved her from taking
walks with her mother. Even Glynese and Carramae
were useful when
they occupied attention that might otherwise have been directed
at her.
At first she had thought she could not stand Mrs. Freeman for she
had
found it was not possible to be rude to her. Mrs. Freeman would take
on
strange resentments and for days together she would be sullen but the
source
of her displeasure was always obscure; a direct attack, a positive
leer, blatant
ugliness to her face
–
these never touched her. And without
warning one
day, she began calling her Hulga.
She did not call her that in front of
Mrs. Hopewell who would have been
incensed but when she and the girl happened to
be out of the house
together, she would say something and add the name Hulga to
the end of
it, and the big spectacled Joy
-
Hulga would scowl and redden as if her
privacy had been intruded upon. She considered the name her personal
affair. She had arrived at it first purely on the basis of its ugly sound
and
then the full genius of its fitness had struck her. She had a vision
of the
name working like the ugly sweating Vulcan who stayed in the furnace
and
to whom, presumably, the goddess had to come when called. She saw
it as
the name of her highest creative act. One of her major triumphs was
that
her mother had not been able to turn her dust into Joy, but the greater
one was
that she had been able to turn it herself into Hulga. However,
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s relish for using the name only irritated her. It was as if
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s beady steel
-
pointed eyes had penetrated far enough
behind her face to
reach some secret fact. Something about her seemed to
fascinate Mrs.
Freeman and then one day Hulga realized that it was the
artificial leg.
Mrs. Freeman had a special fondness for the details of secret
infections, hidden
deformities, assaults upon children. Of diseases, she
preferred the
lingering or incurable. Hulga had heard Mrs. Hopewell give
her the details
of the hunting accident, how the leg had been literally
blasted off, how she had
never lost consciousness. Mrs. Freeman could
listen to it any time as if
it had happened an hour ago.
When Hulga stumped into the kitchen in the
morning (she could walk
without making the awful noise but she made it
–
Mrs.
Hopewell was
certain
–
because it was ugly
-
sounding), she glanced at them and
did not
speak. Mrs. Hopewell would be in her red kimono with her hair tied
around her head in rags. She would be sitting at the table, finishing her
breakfast and Mrs. Freeman would be hanging by her elbow outward
from the
refrigerator, looking down at the table. Hulga always put her
eggs on the
stove to boil and then stood over them with her arms folded,
and Mrs. Hopewell
would look at her
–
a kind of indirect gaze divided
between her and Mrs. Freeman
–
and would think that if she would only
keep herself up a little, she wouldn
’
t
be so bad looking. There was

Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she
was alone, Mrs. Freeman
had two others, forward and
reverse, that she used for all her human
dealings. Her
forward expression was steady and driving like the
advance
of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to left
or right but turned as
the story turned as if they
followed a yellow line down the center of it.
She
seldom used the other expression because it was not
often necessary for her
to retract a statement, but when she did, her face
came to a complete stop,
there was an almost imperceptible movement of
her black eyes, during which they
seemed to be receding, and then the
observer would see that Mrs. Freeman, though
she might stand there as
real as several grain sacks thrown on top of each
other, was no longer
there in spirit. As for getting anything across to
her when this was the
case, Mrs. Hopewell had given it up. She might talk
her head off. Mrs.
Freeman could never be brought to admit herself wrong
to any point. She
would stand there and if she could be brought to say
anything, it was
something like,
“
Well, I wouldn
’
t of said it was and I wouldn
’
t
of said it
wasn
’
t
”
or letting her gaze range over the top kitchen shelf where
there
was an assortment of dusty bottles, she might remark,
“
I see you ain
’
t ate
many of them figs you put up last summer.
”
They carried on their most
important business in the kitchen at breakfast.
Every morning Mrs.
Hopewell got up at seven
o
’
clock and lit her gas
heater and Joy
’
s. Joy was
her daughter, a large blonds girl who had an
artificial leg. Mrs. Hopewell
thought of her as a child though she was
thirty
-
two years old and highly
educated. Joy would get up while her
mother was eating and lumber into the
bathroom and slam the door, and
before long, Mrs. Freeman would arrive at the
back door. Joy would hear
her mother call,
“
Come on in,
”
and then they
would talk for a while in
low voices that were indistinguishable in the
bathroom. By the time Joy
came in, they had usually finished the weather
report and were on one or
the other of Mrs. Freeman
’
s daughters, Glynese or
Carramae. Joy called

them Glycerin and Caramel. Glynese, a redhead,
was eighteen and had
many admirers; Carramae, a blonde, was only fifteen but
already married
and pregnant. She could not keep anything on her
stomach. Every
morning Mrs. Freeman told Mrs. Hopewell how many times she
had
vomited since the last report.
Mrs. Hopewell liked to tell people
that Glynese and Carramae were two
of the finest girls she knew and that Mrs.
Freeman was a
lady
and that she
was never ashamed to take her anywhere or
introduce her to anybody they
might meet. Then she would tell how she had
happened to hire the
Freemans in the first place and how they were a godsend to
her and how
she had had them four years. The reason for her keeping them
so long
was that they were not trash. They were good country people.
She had
telephoned the man whose name they had given as reference and he had
told her that Mr. Freeman was a good farmer but that his wife was the
nosiest
woman ever to walk the earth.
“
She
’
s got to be into everything,
”
the man
said.
“
If she don
’
t get there before the dust settles, you can bet
she
’
s
dead, that
’
s all. She
’
ll want to know all your business. I can stand
him real good,
”
he had said,
“
but me nor my wife neither could have
stood that
woman one more minute on this place.
”
That had put Mrs.
Hopewell off for a
few days.
She had hired them in the end because there were no other
applicants but
she had made up her mind beforehand exactly how she would handle
the
woman. Since she was the type who had to be into everything, then,
Mrs.
Hopewell had decided, she would not only let her be into everything, she
would
see to it
that she was into everything
–
she would give her the
responsibility of everything, she would put her in charge. Mrs. Hopewell
had no bad qualities of her own but she was able to use other people
’
s in
such a
constructive way that she had kept them four years.
Nothing is
perfect. This was one of Mrs. Hopewell
’
s favorite sayings.
Another
was: that is life! And still another, the most important, was:
well, other people have their opinions too. She would make these
statements, usually at the table, in a tone of gentle insistence as if no one
held them but her, and the large hulking Joy, whose constant outrage had
obliterated every expression from her face, would stare just a little to the
side of her, her eyes icy blue, with the look of someone who had achieved
blindness by an act of will and means to keep it.
When Mrs. Hopewell said
to Mrs. Freeman that life was like that, Mrs.
Freeman would say,
“
I always said
so myself.
”
Nothing had been arrived
at by anyone that had not first been
arrived at by her. She was quicker
than Mr. Freeman. When Mrs.
Hopewell said to her after they had been
on the place for a while,
“
You know,
you
’
re the wheel behind the wheel,
”
and winked, Mrs. Freeman had said,
“
I know
it. I
’
ve always been quick.
It
’
s some that are quicker than
others.
”

“
Everybody is different,
”
Mrs. Hopewell said.
“
Yes, most
people is,
”
Mrs. Freeman said.
“
It takes all kinds to make the
world.
”
“
I always said it did myself.
”
The girl was used to this
kind of dialogue for breakfast and more of it for
dinner; sometimes they had it
for supper too. When they had no guest
they ate in the kitchen because
that was easier. Mrs. Freeman always
managed to arrive at some point
during the meal and to watch them finish
it. She would stand in the
doorway if it were summer but in the winter
she would stand with one elbow on
top of the refrigerator and look down
at them, or she would stand by the gas
heater, lifting the back of her skirt
slightly. Occasionally she would
stand against the wall and roll her head
from side to side. At no time was
she in any hurry to leave. All this was
very trying on Mrs. Hopewell but
she was a woman of great patience. She
realized that nothing is perfect
and that in the Freemans she had good
country people and that if, in this day
and age, you get good country
people, you had better hang onto them.
She
had had plenty of experience with trash. Before the Freemans she had
averaged one tenant family a year. The wives of these farmers were not
the
kind you would want to be around you for very long. Mrs. Hopewell,
who had
divorced her husband long ago, needed someone to walk over
the fields with her;
and when Joy had to be impressed for these services,
her remarks were usually so
ugly and her face so glum that Mrs. Hopewell
would say,
“
If you can
’
t come
pleasantly, I don
’
t want you at all,
”
to which
the girl, standing square and
rigid
-
shouldered with her neck thrust
slightly forward, would reply,
“
If you
want me, here I am
–
LIKE I AM.
”
Mrs. Hopewell excused this attitude
because of the leg (which had been
shot off in a hunting accident when Joy was
ten). It was hard for Mrs.
Hopewell to realize that her child was
thirty
-
two now and that for more
than twenty years she had had only one
leg. She thought of her still as a
child because it tore her heart to
think instead of the poor stout girl in her
thirties who had never danced a step
or had any
normal
good times. Her
name was really Joy but as soon
as she was twenty
-
one and away from
home, she had had it legally changed.
Mrs. Hopewell was certain that she
had thought and thought until she had hit
upon the ugliest name in any
language. Then she had gone and had the
beautiful name, Joy, changed
without telling her mother until after she had done

Hulga.

Besides the neutral expression that she wore when she
was alone, Mrs. Freeman
had two others, forward and
reverse, that she used for all her human
dealings. Her
forward expression was steady and driving like the
advance
of a heavy truck. Her eyes never swerved to left
or right but turned as
the story turned as if they
followed a yellow line down the center of it.
She
seldom used the other expression because it was not
often necessary for her
to retract a statement, but when she did, her face
came to a complete stop,
there was an almost imperceptible movement of
her black eyes, during which they
seemed to be receding, and then the
observer would see that Mrs. Freeman, though
she might stand there as
real as several grain sacks thrown on top of each
other, was no longer
there in spirit. As for getting anything across to
her when this was the
case, Mrs. Hopewell had given it up. She might talk
her head off. Mrs.
Freeman could never be brought to admit herself wrong
to any point. She
would stand there and if she could be brought to say
anything, it was
something like,
“
Well, I wouldn
’
t of said it was and I wouldn
’
t
of said it
wasn
’
t
”
or letting her gaze range over the top kitchen shelf where
there
was an assortment of dusty bottles, she might remark,
“
I see you ain
’
t ate
many of them figs you put up last summer.
”
They carried on their most
important business in the kitchen at breakfast.
Every morning Mrs.
Hopewell got up at seven
o
’
clock and lit her gas
heater and Joy
’
s. Joy was
her daughter, a large blonds girl who had an
artificial leg. Mrs. Hopewell
thought of her as a child though she was
thirty
-
two years old and highly
educated. Joy would get up while her
mother was eating and lumber into the
bathroom and slam the door, and
before long, Mrs. Freeman would arrive at the
back door. Joy would hear
her mother call,
“
Come on in,
”
and then they
would talk for a while in
low voices that were indistinguishable in the
bathroom. By the time Joy
came in, they had usually finished the weather
report and were on one or
the other of Mrs. Freeman
’
s daughters, Glynese or
Carramae. Joy called

them Glycerin and Caramel. Glynese, a redhead,
was eighteen and had
many admirers; Carramae, a blonde, was only fifteen but
already married
and pregnant. She could not keep anything on her
stomach. Every
morning Mrs. Freeman told Mrs. Hopewell how many times she
had
vomited since the last report.
Mrs. Hopewell liked to tell people
that Glynese and Carramae were two
of the finest girls she knew and that Mrs.
Freeman was a
lady
and that she
was never ashamed to take her anywhere or
introduce her to anybody they
might meet. Then she would tell how she had
happened to hire the
Freemans in the first place and how they were a godsend to
her and how
she had had them four years. The reason for her keeping them
so long
was that they were not trash. They were good country people.
She had
telephoned the man whose name they had given as reference and he had
told her that Mr. Freeman was a good farmer but that his wife was the
nosiest
woman ever to walk the earth.
“
She
’
s got to be into everything,
”
the man
said.
“
If she don
’
t get there before the dust settles, you can bet
she
’
s
dead, that
’
s all. She
’
ll want to know all your business. I can stand
him real good,
”
he had said,
“
but me nor my wife neither could have
stood that
woman one more minute on this place.
”
That had put Mrs.
Hopewell off for a
few days.
She had hired them in the end because there were no other
applicants but
she had made up her mind beforehand exactly how she would handle
the
woman. Since she was the type who had to be into everything, then,
Mrs.
Hopewell had decided, she would not only let her be into everything, she
would
see to it
that she was into everything
–
she would give her the
responsibility of everything, she would put her in charge. Mrs. Hopewell
had no bad qualities of her own but she was able to use other people
’
s in
such a
constructive way that she had kept them four years.
Nothing is
perfect. This was one of Mrs. Hopewell
’
s favorite sayings.
Another
was: that is life! And still another, the most important, was:
well, other people have their opinions too. She would make these
statements, usually at the table, in a tone of gentle insistence as if no one
held them but her, and the large hulking Joy, whose constant outrage had
obliterated every expression from her face, would stare just a little to the
side of her, her eyes icy blue, with the look of someone who had achieved
blindness by an act of will and means to keep it.
When Mrs. Hopewell said
to Mrs. Freeman that life was like that, Mrs.
Freeman would say,
“
I always said
so myself.
”
Nothing had been arrived
at by anyone that had not first been
arrived at by her. She was quicker
than Mr. Freeman. When Mrs.
Hopewell said to her after they had been
on the place for a while,
“
You know,
you
’
re the wheel behind the wheel,
”
and winked, Mrs. Freeman had said,
“
I know
it. I
’
ve always been quick.
It
’
s some that are quicker than
others.

“
Everybody is different,
”
Mrs. Hopewell said.
“
Yes, most
people is,
”
Mrs. Freeman said.
“
It takes all kinds to make the
world.
”
“
I always said it did myself.
”
The girl was used to this
kind of dialogue for breakfast and more of it for
dinner; sometimes they had it
for supper too. When they had no guest
they ate in the kitchen because
that was easier. Mrs. Freeman always
managed to arrive at some point
during the meal and to watch them finish
it. She would stand in the
doorway if it were summer but in the winter
she would stand with one elbow on
top of the refrigerator and look down
at them, or she would stand by the gas
heater, lifting the back of her skirt
slightly. Occasionally she would
stand against the wall and roll her head
from side to side. At no time was
she in any hurry to leave. All this was
very trying on Mrs. Hopewell but
she was a woman of great patience. She
realized that nothing is perfect
and that in the Freemans she had good
country people and that if, in this day
and age, you get good country
people, you had better hang onto them.
She
had had plenty of experience with trash. Before the Freemans she had
averaged one tenant family a year. The wives of these farmers were not
the
kind you would want to be around you for very long. Mrs. Hopewell,
who had
divorced her husband long ago, needed someone to walk over
the fields with her;
and when Joy had to be impressed for these services,
her remarks were usually so
ugly and her face so glum that Mrs. Hopewell
would say,
“
If you can
’
t come
pleasantly, I don
’
t want you at all,
”
to which
the girl, standing square and
rigid
-
shouldered with her neck thrust
slightly forward, would reply,
“
If you
want me, here I am
–
LIKE I AM.
”
Mrs. Hopewell excused this attitude
because of the leg (which had been
shot off in a hunting accident when Joy was
ten). It was hard for Mrs.
Hopewell to realize that her child was
thirty
-
two now and that for more
than twenty years she had had only one
leg. She thought of her still as a
child because it tore her heart to
think instead of the poor stout girl in her
thirties who had never danced a step
or had any
normal
good times. Her
name was really Joy but as soon
as she was twenty
-
one and away from
home, she had had it legally changed.
Mrs. Hopewell was certain that she
had thought and thought until she had hit
upon the ugliest name in any
language. Then she had gone and had the
beautiful name, Joy, changed
without telling her mother until after she had done
it. Her legal name was
Hulga.
When Mrs. Hopewell thought the name,
Hulga, she thought of the broad

blank hull of a battleship. She would not
use it. She continued to call her
Joy to which the girl responded but in a
purely mechanical way.
Hulga had learned to tolerate Mrs. Freeman who
saved her from taking
walks with her mother. Even Glynese and Carramae
were useful when
they occupied attention that might otherwise have been directed
at her.
At first she had thought she could not stand Mrs. Freeman for she
had
found it was not possible to be rude to her. Mrs. Freeman would take
on
strange resentments and for days together she would be sullen but the
source
of her displeasure was always obscure; a direct attack, a positive
leer, blatant
ugliness to her face
–
these never touched her. And without
warning one
day, she began calling her Hulga.
She did not call her that in front of
Mrs. Hopewell who would have been
incensed but when she and the girl happened to
be out of the house
together, she would say something and add the name Hulga to
the end of
it, and the big spectacled Joy
-
Hulga would scowl and redden as if her
privacy had been intruded upon. She considered the name her personal
affair. She had arrived at it first purely on the basis of its ugly sound
and
then the full genius of its fitness had struck her. She had a vision
of the
name working like the ugly sweating Vulcan who stayed in the furnace
and
to whom, presumably, the goddess had to come when called. She saw
it as
the name of her highest creative act. One of her major triumphs was
that
her mother had not been able to turn her dust into Joy, but the greater
one was
that she had been able to turn it herself into Hulga. However,
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s relish for using the name only irritated her. It was as if
Mrs.
Freeman
’
s beady steel
-
pointed eyes had penetrated far enough
behind her face to
reach some secret fact. Something about her seemed to
fascinate Mrs.
Freeman and then one day Hulga realized that it was the
artificial leg.
Mrs. Freeman had a special fondness for the details of secret
infections, hidden
deformities, assaults upon children. Of diseases, she
preferred the
lingering or incurable. Hulga had heard Mrs. Hopewell give
her the details
of the hunting accident, how the leg had been literally
blasted off, how she had
never lost consciousness. Mrs. Freeman could
listen to it any time as if
it had happened an hour ago.
When Hulga stumped into the kitchen in the
morning (she could walk
without making the awful noise but she made it
–
Mrs.
Hopewell was
certain
–
because it was ugly
-
sounding), she glanced at them and
did not
speak. Mrs. Hopewell would be in her red kimono with her hair tied
around her head in rags. She would be sitting at the table, finishing her
breakfast and Mrs. Freeman would be hanging by her elbow outward
from the
refrigerator, looking down at the table. Hulga always put her
eggs on the
stove to boil and then stood over them with her arms folded,
and Mrs. Hopewell
would look at her
–
a kind of indirect gaze divided
between her and Mrs. Freeman
–
and would think that if she would only
keep herself up a little, she wouldn
’
t
be so bad looking. There was
