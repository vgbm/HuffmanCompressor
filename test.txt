Turn it inside out so I can see
The part of you that's driftin' over me
And when I wake you're, you never there
But when I sleep you're, you everywhere
You everywhere

Just tell me, how I got this far?
Just tell me, why you're here? And who you are?
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, ooo ooo ooo
I'm not alone

I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, ooo ooo
I'm not alone

I am not alone
Waa ooo, waa ooo, waa ooo, waa

And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day aay aay
No matter where I go
I'll always feel you so

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, waa waa ohh yea

'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath
It's you I breathe
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, waa waa ohh

You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?



Here we are, right back at the start
You put your hand on my heart
And you ask me to take you back once again
I dont care cause my hearts on the dance floor
And I dont wanna hear you talk anymore, dont talk anymore

If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Baby dont say youre sorry
If you wanna take me, take me away tonight
I dont wanna hear you say to me
You were wrong to cut and run
Cant this wait until the morning comes
If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me
If you want me
Shut up and dance, get up and dance

Now Im lost in the music again
I dont want it to end
Just let it take you away, yea take me away
Baby dont talk while your hearts on the dance floor
I dont wanna hear you talk anymore, dont talk anymore

If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Baby dont say youre sorry
If you wanna take me, take me away tonight
I dont wanna hear you say to me
You were wrong to cut and run
Cant this wait until the morning comes
If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me

Theres so much to say, I know yesterday
And that you torn me apart!
But baby I know, youre sorry I know
That you would never mean to break my heart

If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Baby dont say youre sorry
If you wanna take me, take me away tonight
I dont wanna hear you say to me
You were wrong to cut and run
Cant this wait until the morning comes
If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me

If you want me
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
